# Final Spawn Marker Implementation - SIMPLIFIED

## ✅ How It Works (CLEAR & SIMPLE)

### For Standard Arena Setup (Duel/1v1)

When you're in **Positions** mode:

#### Setting Spawn Positions
- **Left-click on a BLOCK** → Sets Position 1 (Blue spawn)
- **Right-click on a BLOCK** → Sets Position 2 (Red spawn)
- Markers appear to show where spawns are
- Markers are visual indicators only (cannot be clicked to remove)

### For FFA Arena Setup

When you're in **FFA Positions** mode:

#### Adding Spawns
- **Right-click on a BLOCK** → Adds new spawn at that location
- Marker appears immediately with label "FFA Spawn #X (Right-click to remove)"

#### Removing Specific Spawn
- **Right-click on an ARMOR STAND** → Removes that spawn
- Works from **ANY distance** (even while flying!)
- Just look at the marker and click it

#### Removing Last Spawn
- **Left-click anywhere** → Removes the last spawn you added

### Example Workflow

```
FFA Arena Setup:
1. Enter FFA Positions mode
2. Fly around your arena
3. Right-click BLOCKS to place 18 spawns
4. Fly up to review
5. See "FFA Spawn #7 (Right-click to remove)" is in a bad spot?
   → Look at its armor stand and right-click
   → Removed!
6. Right-click a BLOCK where you want the new spawn #7
7. Done!

Standard Arena Setup:
1. Enter Positions mode
2. Left-click BLOCK → Sets Spawn 1 (marker appears)
3. Right-click BLOCK → Sets Spawn 2 (marker appears)
4. Done!
```

## 🎯 Key Points

**Standard Arena (Duel):**
- Click BLOCKS to set positions
- Markers show where spawns are (visual only)
- 2 spawn positions total

**FFA Arena:**
- Click BLOCK = Add spawn
- Click ARMOR STAND = Remove that spawn (works from any distance!)
- Left-click = Undo last
- Up to 18 spawns

## 🛡️ Protection

- All armor stands are **invulnerable** - can't be damaged
- All armor stands are **protected** - can't manipulate equipment
- FFA markers can be right-clicked to remove
- Standard markers are visual only

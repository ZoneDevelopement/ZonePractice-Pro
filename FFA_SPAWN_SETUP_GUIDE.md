# FFA Spawn Setup - Quick Guide

## How It Works (FFA ARENAS ONLY)

When you're in **FFA Positions** mode with the setup wand:

### Adding Spawns
✅ **Right-click on a block**
- Creates spawn at that location
- New marker appears immediately with player head and red boots
- Can add up to 18 total spawns

### Removing Specific Spawn ⭐ 
✅ **Right-click directly on the armor stand marker**
- Works from **any distance** (even while flying!)
- Look at the spawn marker you want to remove
- Right-click on it
- That specific spawn is removed instantly
- Example: Flying above arena, look at "FFA Spawn #3 (Right-click to remove)" marker, right-click → Removes spawn #3

### Removing Last Spawn
✅ **Left-click anywhere**
- Quick way to undo the most recent spawn addition
- Removes the last spawn you added

## ⚠️ Note: FFA Arenas Only

**This armor stand removal feature ONLY works for FFA arenas.**

For standard arenas (Duel/1v1):
- Use **left-click on blocks** to set Position 1
- Use **right-click on blocks** to set Position 2
- Armor stand markers are visual indicators only (cannot be clicked to remove)

## Visual Example

```
You're flying above the arena:

    [FFA Spawn #1 (Right-click to remove)]
         ↑
         | (You look at it from far away)
         |
    Right-click → REMOVES Spawn #1
    
    
    Empty block
         ↓
    Right-click → ADDS new spawn
```

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Adding FFA Spawns
1. Switch to "FFA Positions" mode (shift-click wand)
2. Walk/fly to desired spawn location
3. **Right-click on a block**
4. New spawn marker appears with player head and red boots

### Removing Specific Spawn ⭐ BEST METHOD
1. Look at the spawn marker you want to remove (from any distance)
2. **Right-click directly on the armor stand**
3. Spawn is removed instantly
4. Perfect for removing specific spawns while flying

### Removing Last Spawn
1. Simply **left-click** anywhere
2. Most recent spawn is removed

## Protection Features

🛡️ **Armor stands are fully protected:**
- Cannot be punched or damaged
- Cannot change equipment or pose
- Only work when you're in FFA Positions mode
- Only work when setting up the correct arena

## Tips

✨ **Flying setup** - Fly around your arena and click armor stands to remove unwanted spawns
✨ **Quick add** - Right-click blocks to add spawns as you fly/walk around
✨ **Quick undo** - Left-click to remove the last spawn you added
✨ **Easy to see** - Red boots and player heads make markers visible from far away
✨ **Labels above** - Spawn numbers float above the armor stands

## Common Workflow

1. Enter FFA Positions mode
2. Fly/walk around and right-click blocks to add all 18 spawns
3. Review from above by flying
4. Right-click any armor stand markers that are in wrong positions
5. Add replacement spawns as needed
6. Done!

## Benefits

✨ **Protected markers** - can't accidentally damage them
✨ **Simple controls** - right-click to add/remove, left-click to undo
